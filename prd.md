### New Response Field Details

**settlementEstimate** (object, optional)

- **p25Minutes** (number): 25th percentile settlement time in minutes
- **p75Minutes** (number): 75th percentile settlement time in minutes
- **displayRange** (string): Human-readable range for UI display (e.g., "15-49 minutes")
- **confidenceLevel** (string): Data quality indicator ("high", "medium", "low")
- **dataSource** (string): Source of settlement data ("exact_route_with_asset", "route_with_different_asset", "route_category_average")
- **assetSymbol** (string): Asset symbol used for estimation (e.g., "USDC", "WETH", "USDT")
- **sampleSize** (number): Number of transactions used for calculation
- **note** (string, optional): Additional context for fallback estimates
- **lastUpdated** (string): ISO date when settlement data was last refreshed

### Error Handling

- Missing route data: Return existing quote response without `settlementEstimate` field
- Invalid amount: Return estimate for closest available bin
- Missing asset data: Fall back to any available asset data for the route
- Missing route entirely: Use L1/L2 classification averages
- System errors: Gracefully degrade without affecting existing quote functionality
- Aggregator-friendly error responses with clear messaging

### Backward Compatibility

- All existing response fields remain unchanged
- `settlementEstimate` is optional and will be `null` or omitted for routes without sufficient data
- Existing integrations continue to work without modification
- New field can be safely ignored by clients not using settlement data

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance Requirements

- **Response Time**: Quote endpoint response time SHALL remain under 200ms (currently ~150ms)
- **Throughput**: Support aggregator-scale load (10x current volume projected)
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime maintained (critical for aggregator reliability)

### Data Requirements

- **Freshness**: Settlement data SHALL be updated daily
- **Coverage**: Include all 27 supported chains and 3 primary assets (WETH, USDT, USDC)
- **Retention**: Maintain 30-day rolling window of historical data
- **Transparency**: Provide sample sizes and confidence indicators

### Security Requirements

- **Rate Limiting**: Existing API rate limits SHALL apply with consideration for aggregator needs
- **Data Privacy**: No user-identifiable information in settlement calculations
- **Input Validation**: All quote parameters SHALL be validated before processing

## Technical Implementation

### Data Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Leverage existing Goldsky/analytics infrastructure
2. **Data Processing**: Daily ETL job to calculate percentiles and update lookup tables
3. **Data Storage**: Optimized JSON structure for fast lookups (as demonstrated in lookup_example.js)
4. **Cache Strategy**: In-memory caching with daily refresh cycle
5. **Aggregator-Scale Optimization**: Ensure performance at 10x current volume

### Integration Points

- **Existing Quote API**: Extend current `/routes/quote` endpoint response
- **Analytics Pipeline**: Connect to existing settlement tracking system
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for data storage, Redis for caching
- **Aggregator Partnerships**: Direct integration support for Li.Fi and other partners

### Fallback Strategy

The system implements a **three-tier fallback strategy** to ensure comprehensive coverage:

1. **Exact Route with Specific Asset** (Highest Priority)
   - Look for exact match: `fromChain -> toChain -> assetSymbol -> amountRange`
   - Provides most accurate estimates based on actual asset data
   - Confidence level: "high"

2. **Any Available Asset Data** (Medium Priority)
   - If specific asset not found, use any available asset data for the route
   - Example: Requesting USDT data but only WETH data available
   - Confidence level: "medium"
   - Includes note explaining which asset data was used

3. **Asset-Specific L1/L2 Route Category Averages** (Lowest Priority)
   - Use asset-specific route category averages (L2â†’L1, L2â†’L2, L1â†’L2, L1â†’L1)
   - Based on historical performance patterns for specific assets
   - Structure: `route_category -> asset_symbol -> amount_range -> settlement_data`
   - Confidence level: "low" to "medium"
   - Includes note explaining the estimation method and asset used

- If no data available: Return existing quote response without `settlementEstimate`
- If lookup fails: Log error, return base quote functionality
- Graceful degradation to maintain service availability
- Clear communication to aggregators when data is missing

### Chain ID to Chain Name Mapping

- System SHALL convert chainId values from request to chain names for settlement lookup
- Support all existing chainId mappings (42161 = arbitrum, 1 = ethereum, etc.)
- Asset address SHALL be mapped to standardized asset symbols (USDC, USDT, WETH, cbBTC, xPufETH)
- Asset symbol mapping SHALL be used for asset-specific settlement time lookup

## User Experience

### Aggregator Integration Experience

javascript

`*// Li.Fi integration example*
const everclearQuote = await fetch('/routes/quote', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    originChainId: 42161,  *// Arbitrum*
    destinationChainId: 1, *// Ethereum*
    asset: "0xa0b86a33e6fe17d1c55c4acb1e7c5e6e1f3f8c2d", *// USDC*
    amount: "100000000000000000000000" *// 100k USDC*
  })
});

const response = await everclearQuote.json();
const { fees, settlementEstimate } = response;

*// Aggregator displays in UI:// "Everclear: $90 fee, 15-49 min settlement (based on 180 recent transactions)"*
if (settlementEstimate) {
  displaySettlementTime(settlementEstimate.displayRange, settlementEstimate.sampleSize);
}`

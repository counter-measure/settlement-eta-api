# Settlement Times Bin Generation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the work done to populate missing transaction amount bins in the `settlement_times.json` data file.

## Problem Identified
The original `settlement_times.json` file was missing many transaction amount bins for most combinations of:
- `origin_chain_id`
- `destination_chain_id` 
- `tickerhash`

### Expected Bins (Based on Case Statement)
1. `0-50000` (0 < amount ≤ 50,000)
2. `50000-100000` (50,000 < amount ≤ 100,000)
3. `100000-300000` (100,000 < amount ≤ 300,000)
4. `300000-400000` (300,000 < amount ≤ 400,000)
5. `400000-500000` (400,000 < amount ≤ 500,000)
6. `500000-700000` (500,000 < amount ≤ 700,000)
7. `700000-1000000` (700,000 < amount ≤ 1,000,000)
8. `1000000+` (amount > 1,000,000)

### Data Coverage Analysis
- **Total combinations**: 2,799
- **Combinations with missing bins**: 243 (8.7%)
- **Combinations with all bins**: 2,556 (91.3%)

## Solution Implemented

### Script 1: Basic Bin Generation (`generate_missing_bins.py`)
- **Approach**: Used maximum values from the same bin sizes across other combinations
- **Output**: `settlement_times_populated.json`
- **Issue**: Generated many bins with 0.0 values due to lack of existing data

### Script 2: Improved Bin Generation (`generate_missing_bins_improved.py`)
- **Approach**: Multi-strategy intelligent estimation
- **Output**: `settlement_times_populated_improved.json`
- **Strategies**:
  1. **Cross-combination averages**: Use existing data from the same bin across all combinations
  2. **Weighted interpolation**: Interpolate from surrounding bins with distance-based weighting
  3. **Baseline scaling**: Scale from the `0-50000` bin using conservative multipliers
  4. **Default fallback**: Use reasonable default values as last resort

## Results

### Before Generation
- File size: 76,222 bytes
- Missing bins: 243 combinations
- Data completeness: 91.3%

### After Generation (Improved Version)
- File size: 577,316 bytes
- Missing bins: 0 combinations
- Data completeness: 100%

## Generated Data Characteristics

### Sample Generated Bin (50000-100000)
```json
{
  "settlement_duration_minutes_p25": 25.53,
  "settlement_duration_minutes_p50": 69.1,
  "settlement_duration_minutes_p75": 201.51,
  "sample_size": 0,
  "generated": true,
  "method": "weighted_interpolation"
}
```

### Metadata Added
- `"generated": true` - Indicates this bin was artificially created
- `"method": "..."` - Shows which generation strategy was used
- `"sample_size": 0` - Indicates no actual transaction data exists

## Usage

### To Check for Missing Bins
```bash
python3 find_missing_bins.py [filename]
```

### To Generate Missing Bins
```bash
python3 generate_missing_bins_improved.py
```

## Recommendations

1. **Use the improved version** (`settlement_times_populated_improved.json`) as it provides more realistic estimates
2. **Monitor generated bins** - These are estimates and should be replaced with real data when available
3. **Consider data collection** - Focus on collecting transaction data for higher amount ranges to improve accuracy
4. **Regular updates** - Re-run the generation script as new data becomes available

## Files Created

- `find_missing_bins.py` - Analysis script to identify missing bins
- `generate_missing_bins.py` - Basic bin generation script
- `generate_missing_bins_improved.py` - Intelligent bin generation script
- `settlement_times_populated.json` - Basic populated data
- `settlement_times_populated_improved.json` - Improved populated data (recommended)
- `BIN_GENERATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Next Steps

1. **Validate estimates** - Review generated values for reasonableness
2. **Collect real data** - Focus on transactions in missing amount ranges
3. **Update regularly** - Re-run generation as new data becomes available
4. **Monitor performance** - Track how well estimates perform in production
